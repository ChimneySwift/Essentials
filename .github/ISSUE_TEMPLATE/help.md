NOTE: Failure to fill out this template properly may result in your issue being
      delayed or ignored.

Don't put anything inside this block, as it will be hidden when you post your
PR. Make sure to also not type between any arrows in the template, as this text
will also be hidden.

Want faster support? Come join our Discord server to get help from both
developers and community members: https://discord.gg/F7gexAQ

If you're happy to wait (or you were sent here from Discord), read on:

1.  Check the Common Issues page.
      Read through the wiki page to see if you've encountered a regular issue:
      https://essentialsx.net/wiki/Common-Issues.html

2.  Fill out the template.
      Run the commands in the console. Don't just put "latest" as a version, or
      we will ignore it. This will help us understand what problem you've
      encountered and help us find a solution.

3.  When linking logs or config files, do not attach them to the post!
      Copy and paste any logs into https://gist.github.com/, then paste a
      link to them in the relevant parts of the template. Do not use Hastebin
      or Pastebin, as this can cause issues when trying to solve issues in the
      future.
      DO NOT drag logs into this box!

4.  If you are encountering a performance issue, please include a link to a
    Timings and/or profiler report, both before and after your PR.
