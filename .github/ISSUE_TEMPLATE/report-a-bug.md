<!-- EssentialsX bug reporting guide

NOTE: Failure to fill out this template properly may result in your issue being
      delayed or ignored.

Don't put anything inside this block, as it will be hidden when you post your
PR. Make sure to also not type between any arrows in the template, as this text
will also be hidden.

If you are reporting a bug, please follow the following steps:

1.  Fill out the template in full.
      Run the commands in the console. Don't just put "latest" as a version,
      or we will ignore it.

2.  When linking files, do not attach them to the post!
      Copy and paste any logs into https://gist.github.com/, then paste a
      link to them in the relevant parts of the template. Avoid using
      Hastebin or Pastebin, as this makes providing support more difficult.
      **DO NOT drag files into this box!**

3.  If you are reporting a performance issue, please include a link to a
    Timings and/or profiler report.

4.  If you are reporting a bug with commands or something else in-game,
    please include screenshots to help us diagnose the problem.
